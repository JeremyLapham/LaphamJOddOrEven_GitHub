Odd or Even
This program will ask the user to input a number and it will tell them if that number is odd or even
Peer Review by Carlos Felipe: The program runs well. It has replayability and data validation for everything except when it asks you if you want to play again. If the user enters anything or "" (nothing) then it restarts the program. It only ends if the user types in 'end'. This is the only thing I found that needed some improvement. The rest of the program works well.
